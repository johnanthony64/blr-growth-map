 What This Project Does

This dashboard answers one core question:

 **Where is the next real estate boom in Bangalore coming from?**

It focuses on three high-growth corridors:
- **North Bangalore (Airport / Aerospace Park)**
- **East Bangalore (Whitefield / Budigere / Hoskote)**
- **South-East Bangalore (Sarjapur / ORR)**

The dashboard is supported by a **detailed PDF report** that explains infrastructure drivers and developer behavior in depth.

The analysis is inspired by how Tier-1 developers like **Prestige, Brigade, and Godrej** allocate capital ahead of infrastructure cycles.
